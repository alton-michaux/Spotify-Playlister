### My Spotify Playlist App

- This app was designed to show off my collection of playlists using Spotify's API.

- Currently this app uses the `Client credentials` OAuth flow, but in the future will switch to one of either the `Authorization code` or `Implicit grant` modes to allow users to sign in with their own Spotify account, listen to the playlists and follow those playlists if they'd like.

- Feel free to browse my playlists and enjoy the album art.

- Music coming soon!
